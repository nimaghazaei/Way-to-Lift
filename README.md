# Way To Lift
Probebly you think lifting a server from ground is a simple light weight job to do, but it's not!
no matter you're a non athletic person or a bodybuilding champion , if you do it wrong; you are very likely to hurt yourself.

in order to prevent injuries when you have to lift and move some servers and make it as a workuot , I have some advices for you :).

## Be An IT Champ !
- First thing first , **warm yourselft up**. always do a few reps of squats or deadlift exersices and make sure you warmed up your legs and back.
- Do not lift the server when it's horizentaly on the ground , always flip it to the **vertical** form to a side.
- **use your legs to lift not only your back**. the majority of peapol doesn't lift in this way.
- Don't bend your lower back.
- Don't bend your arms.
- Don't look forward. means don't bend your neck out of alignment with the rest of your body.
- Do same exact these observation to putting down.
